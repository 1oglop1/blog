:summary: Python, curiosity, experiments and results

My name is Jan Gazda and I'm a curious person with too many interests.
Apart from riding BMX, listening to many kinds of music
I fell in love with Python programming language.


Python
------

During my studies at the `VŠB TU Ostrava`_ we were taught in many languages,
C, C++, Java, but none of these classes was a really satisfying and good introduction
to programming for me.
Until I stumbled upon a Python course.

I quickly found out that Python is not only a great programming language but
also the community is very welcoming for the newcomers.

..

    Come for the Language, Stay for the Community.

And we are very lucky to have one of the best python communities right in the Czech Republic.
So if you are interested, jump on one PyVo_.

After I moved to Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and found out that community is not so active
which made me realize how much I miss it.

I started my endeavour to grow a PyVo_ culture here and build a small group of organisers.
Together we started a meetup group called PyAmsterdam_ (`at meetup.com`_) which already has ~700 members!
